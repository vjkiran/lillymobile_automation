Description: ======================
        pycmd scripts
        ======================
        
        ``pycmd`` is a collection of command line tools for helping with Python development.
        
        ``py.cleanup``: remove ``.pyc`` and similar files
        =============================================================
        
        Usage: ``py.cleanup [PATH]``
        
        Delete pyc file recursively, starting from ``PATH`` (which defaults to the
        current working directory). Don't follow links and don't recurse into
        directories with a ".".
        
        ``py.lookup``: find text in recursively found .py files 
        ====================================================================
        
        Usage: ``py.lookup SEARCH_STRING [options]``
        
        Looks recursively at Python files for a ``SEARCH_STRING``, starting from the
        present working directory. Prints the line, with the filename and line-number
        prepended.
        
        
        ``py.countloc``: give LOCs for lines and testlines
        =================================================================
        
        Usage: ``py.countloc [PATHS]``
        
        Count (non-empty) lines of python code and number of python files recursively
        starting from a ``PATHS`` given on the command line (starting from the current
        working directory). Distinguish between test files and normal ones and report
        them separately.
        
        ``py.which``: print location of an importable package or module
        =====================================================================
        
        Usage: ``py.which modulename``
        
        Print the ``__file__`` of the module that is imported via ``import modulename``.
        The version-suffix is the same as with ``py.test`` above.
